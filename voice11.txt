Live from the coffee pot, throwing a little caffeine in, getting a little coffee, getting ready to go. Kick off. Hours underway. Hey, Rick here. Uh, a lot going on. We got golden ticket seats coming in from all over. We're going to spend the the wonderful will of canned meat today. Uh, this thing with Biden and Normandy. Do I even bring that up with Greg in the room? I don't know whether. What's real. What's not real. I saw Babylon Bee saying, Biden drops the first bomb on Normandy in 80 years. I don't know. But anyway, uh, Sherry and I also headed out to Sikeston, Missouri today. Uh, tonight there'll be a men's event at Minor Baptist Church. Tomorrow morning, she'll do a women's event tomorrow night. We both do a marriage event together, and then I'm preaching on Sunday. So, uh, tonight, tomorrow night and Sunday morning, uh, we'll be all in Sikeston, Missouri. Uh, Lord willing, will be there at Minor Baptist Church. Uh, so looking forward to seeing all of you that are going to be coming to, to those services this weekend as well. So another Rick and Bubba show about to start, Bubba and I'll join the guys here shortly.
