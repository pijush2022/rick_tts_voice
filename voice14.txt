How's it going, everybody? Rick here at the office, uh, getting some emails. Understand, uh, that some of you are having issues with some of our websites, and there's a reason for that. There has been a technical problem. Uh, and, uh, the company that the host, all of our websites, they are they are dealing with that. So the Rick and bubba.com website, you can see it, but you'll notice that upcoming events and other things that it's dated which means it's it was just it was pulled from, from an old setup. Uh, so it's not going to be current. Uh, Burgess Ministries and the man church com are both down. So we apologize for that. But we feel like, uh, we should get those back up and running by tomorrow. We hope so. So, uh, it is not on your end. We are having an issue. If you have any questions at all, you can certainly email me, uh, Rick at Rick and bubba.com or Rick at Burgess Ministries. Com if there's some information you're looking for that you can't access today. Thanks a lot.
