What's up Rick and Bubba family back for another show today. Kick off. Our, uh, is rolling now. Bubba has already stepped into this world. Uh, I can sense Helms's dabbling in it. Um, I've got word from my wife, Sherry, uh, that tonight, uh, I am scheduled to play pickleball. Uh, her, me and another couple. Um, so this is it. Um, I asked her how how close she was to to these people, and and and me entering into this world. Just. I don't feel good about it. Um, it feels very, very much like a cult, you know, like I've been invited to some sort of, you know, service or something. Uh, like, uh, almost like somebody asked you to come to one of those pyramid things. So, uh, we'll talk a little bit about that on the show today as another Rick and Bubba show rolls on.
