
How's it going? Rick and Bob, a family. Um, coming in a little bit later than normal today. You can see right here. Look at my window of the truck. Uh, sun already coming up. Uh, another week on Rick and Bob. I couldn't find my keyfob this morning. Uh, you know, it's, uh, this this weekend was so, uh, covered up and and women things. I mean, two weddings, two receptions. Uh, it was just crazy. It's like my truck father protested because he knew it wasn't needed. Apparently you don't drive trucks to to weddings and receptions, but, uh, but anyway, uh, stories from the weekend. Uh, we got those for you today. Uh, of course we want you to get involved at eight, six, six. We'd be big, and we got a lot to to talk about today. I've got a story from the weekend that, uh. Um. Well, I'll. I'll share it with you as best I can.


I can't get too detailed because there's still a lot of shrapnel from it. Uh, but, uh, we'll we'll talk about this, uh, pretty much spent the weekend in the doghouse, uh, and we'll talk about that and, uh, and, you know, continue the updates with all the stuff going on with our country. How do we look? Good, don't we? I saw where Babylon be. Had a picture of George Washington looking down on, uh, on Washington, DC and from heaven, and it said, you know, 250 years. Not a bad run. Uh, we'll talk to you today on the brand new Rick and Bubba show. Hope you'll join us.
