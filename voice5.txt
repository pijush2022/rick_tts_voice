Hey guys, sorry. Um Speedy messed the dates up. I thought Leanne Morgan was on the show today. That's what we were told. I don't know if you caught the show, Speedy had the wrong date. She's actually supposed to be on on the 20th now. Bub and I are about to go do a podcast and all we can think of is this really next week's guest we're about to interview. So sorry about getting uh the Leanne Morgan fans all worked into a frenzy only to be let down and then told it's actually next Thursday. So, uh sorry about that.
