Coffee time. What's going on? Everybody ready for the weekend. Uh So we got Friday edition of the show today. Golden ticket seats coming from all over, man. It's just amazing to, uh, I mean, we talk, I had somebody here last week that drove 900 miles. Um And we, and we, and we begged them, surely you had some of the reasons, something you were doing. You didn't just come all the way here just to sit and, and, and watch a bunch of goods. Uh But, but it's incredible to, to see that and, uh today we'll get another opportunity to hang out with, uh with some of our, uh, you know, people that have been part of the Rick and Bubba family for a long time. Uh Some of them that, uh maybe just in the last several months. Uh So it's a great opportunity. We look forward to it. Now, the golden ticket seats are completely booked up. There's, there's none left for the rest of the year. Uh But uh we'll still uh spend the wonderful little can meet rock and roll city. Uh, may or may not be able to play today because Greg is actually off today. So we'll see, uh, but we'll cover the stories of the day and hope to hear from you. Uh, at 866, we be big.
