Live from the coffee pot. I hope all of you had a great weekend. Enjoy the best of shows on our best of show! I guess we only had one of those on Friday. Monday was a replay, uh, on Memorial Day. So we'll recap, uh, all the stories, uh, from the weekend. Uh, hopefully not now with some of y'all when you come off, uh, a 3 or 4 day weekend, you know, trying to get you fired up on the phones, it's like, you know, pulling teeth. Uh, so we'll try not to lean on you too hard today, so. But we'll recap everything that happened over the long weekend. Uh, and, uh, run down the stories of the day. I don't know what's happened. You know, uh, as far as around the world since we've been gone, I kind of stayed away from the news, but, uh, everybody's back. I've already seen everybody in the offices. Uh, the kickoff hour is underway, Bubba, and I'll join them along with Adler, uh, here in just a bit. So, uh, welcome back to another show on another day, uh, and another week. And hope you had a great weekend.
